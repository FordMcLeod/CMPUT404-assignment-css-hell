Assignment: CSS Hell
====================

# Gutenberg Books

For my gutenberg books to reskin I chose texts written by James Joyce. The only modifications to the HTML Documents made were removal of the previous inline css and fixing links to the images. I aimed to produce an aged aesthetic, brought in the text so it's readable and not spread across the whole width of the page, and styled corners and drop shadows on the images

# Homepage

It's a very basic homepage. I added in a navigation bar which is partially functional which could be further evolved if I wanted to host multiple pages or resources from my homepage.

# Citations

I referred to the following sources:

[CSS-tricks, Guide to Flexbox](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=2ahUKEwiAg9G06NLgAhVprVQKHZoRCGsQFjAAegQICBAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcss-tricks.com%2Fsnippets%2Fcss%2Fa-guide-to-flexbox%2F&usg=AOvVaw13L8vethSS3eyj6Ne-toCj)
